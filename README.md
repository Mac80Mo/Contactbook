This is a contact management site based on php. Just for me as I am developing my php-skills at the moment.

The basic setup I learned from a video-tutorial by JunusErgin / Programmieren lernen.

For this project I use XAMPP / Apache | Localhost:
so you need to put the files in the htdocs folder (create a seperate folder in htdocs) to run on your localhost.

The Input (contacts) are saved in a .txt-file / json-format (will be created when adding a contact).

It works! But now I want to develope it quite a little more, with some more features:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Done:

- some css-styling to fit in for me.

- like a login (visibility of some features only with the correct login)
    11.01.2025: Done!
        Made a login & logout function:
            Implemented a Login / Logout -button in the "menu".
            Without beeing logged-in you got the whole view but can't see contacts or add contacts.
            With a Login you are able to see the contacts and add new ones.
            The "username" and the "password" are set directly in the source-code and you can set them there..

In progress:
