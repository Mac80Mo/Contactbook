This is a contact management site based on php. Just for me as I am developing my php-skills at the moment.

The basic setup I learned from a video-tutorial by JunusErgin / Programmieren lernen.

For this project I use XAMPP / Apache | Localhost:
so you need to put the files in the htdocs folder (create a seperate folder in htdocs) to run on your localhost.

The Input (contacts) are saved in a .txt-file / json-format (will be created when adding a contact).

It works! But now I want to develope it quite a little more, with some more features..

Done:

- some css-styling to fit in for me.


In progress:

- like a login (visibility of some features only with the correct login)
